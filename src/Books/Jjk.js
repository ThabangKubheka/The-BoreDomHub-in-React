            <h1>Jujutsu Kaisen</h1>

            <p>
                A boy swallows a cursed talisman - the finger of a demon - and becomes cursed himself.
                He enters a shaman's school to be able to locate the demon's other body parts and thus exorcise himself.
                Yuji Itadori, a kind-hearted teenager, joins his school's Occult Club for fun, but discovers that its members 
                are actual sorcerers who can manipulate the energy between beings for their own use. He hears about a cursed 
                talisman - the finger of Sukuna, a demon - and its being targeted by other cursed beings. Yuji eats the finger 
                to protect his friends, and ends up becoming Sukuna's host. However, Yuji discovers that he has inherited magic 
                and is able to control this power without interference from Sukuna. He joins the Tokyo Metropolitan Magic Technical College
                 to consumes all of Sukuna's fingers, which will enable a full exorcism to take place that will free him.
