            <h1>Demon Slayer</h1>

            <p>
                Tanjiro Kamado, our protagonist, is a youth whose family is brutally murdered by a demon.
                Although badly injured, his sister, Nezuko, is the sole survivor of the attack.
                Tanjiro rushes to town in a desperate attempt to find medical assistance for her.
                Along the way, she wakes and suddenly attacks him. As Nezuko attempts to kill him, an incredible swordsman appears.
                The man attempts to kill Tanjiro’s demon sister, but Tanjiro protects her with his life.
                He tries fighting the man but is utterly outclassed.
                He learns that the man is a member of an underground force, known as the Demon Slayer Corps.
                Although he loses the battle, Tanjiro gains the man’s respect through his valiant effort and is later
                recommended to train under the retired Water Hashira, Sakonji Urokodaki.
