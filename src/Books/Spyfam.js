            <p>
                "Twilight" is assigned possibly his hardest mission yet, Operation Strix.
                 As part of this mission he needs to marry and have a child in order to get close to his target Donovan Desmond. 
                 He ends up adopting Anya, a telepath, and marrying Yor, an assassin,
                 however, all of them are hiding their identities from one another.

                To complete his mission, 
                "Twilight" needs to get Anya enrolled in the prestigious 
                Eden Academy so that she can get close to his target's son, Damian Desmond. 
                To do that, Anya will need to become an Imperial Scholar by earning 8 Stella Stars,
                 but the real challenge for "Twilight" though is making sure she doesn't get 8 Tonitrus Bolts and get expelled!
