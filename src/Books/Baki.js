            <p>
                After being poisoned by the death row convict Yanagi,
                Baki Hanma has been reduced to an emaciated husk.
                He can barely stand, much less fight. But fight he must.
                The Great Raitai Tournament, an ancient Chinese Martial Arts contest, is set to begin,
                and Baki has received an invitation. Baki cannot simply refuse.
                After all, among the tournament's roster is Muhammad Alai Jr.,
                son of the greatest boxer to ever live, and Baki's own father,
                Yujiro Hanma, the strongest man in the world who Baki has sworn to beat in combat.
                At the head of the tournament are the Sea Kings; an order of
                Martial Artists who embody the ancient tenets of Chinese fighting.
                Foremost among them is Sea King Kaku, the champion of the arena who has yet to bested,
                even at 146 years old. Will Baki recover from his ailment and survive? And who will triumph?
                Will the raw power of Yujiro Hanma slam its fist and obliterate the arena? Or will a thousand years
                of Martial Arts tradition stand strong and prevail?v
