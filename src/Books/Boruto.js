            <p>
                The Hidden Leaf Village has entered an era of peace and modernization.
                Skyscrapers line the streets, videos play on giant screens,
                and a network of trains runs through the village.
                Though still a ninja village, more civilians than ever roam its streets,
                and the shinobi must evolve with the times. While Naruto Uzumaki leads the village as the Seventh Hokage,
                his son Boruto begins his own journey at the Ninja Academy.
                Boruto's classmates only see him as "the Hokage's son", but his wild and unpredictable personality quickly blows that perception away!
                With new friends by his side, how will Boruto handle the mysterious incidents occurring around him?
                A new wind is blowing, stirring up hearts as it goes. The story of Boruto Uzumaki begins now!
