                This Disney animated feature follows the adventures of the young lion Simba, the heir of his father, Mufasa.
                Simba's wicked uncle, Scar,
                plots to usurp Mufasa's throne by luring father and son into a stampede of wildebeests.
                But Simba escapes, and only Mufasa is killed. Simba returns as
                an adult to take back his homeland from Scar with the help of his friends Timon and Pumbaa.

                After being anointed as the next king of the jungle, young lion cub Simba is every bit
                as eager to take his proud father Mufasa's place as the king.
                However, this makes Simba's villainous uncle Scar jealous of him.
                But when Mufasa is suddenly murdered by Scar, Simba feels responsible for his death and runs away from home.
                Meeting up with two outcasts named Timon and Pumbaa, Simba embraces their ways of 'Hakuna Matata'.
                Years later, approached by his childhood friend Nala and the wise baboon Rafiki,
                Simba must return home to stop Scar's evil reign and fulfill his destiny as the new king.
